        <div class="col-sm-12 wow fadeInLeftBig">        
          <p class="lead">
            Defibrillation, in terms of extracellular electrical stimulation or current injection, has been prevalently used to treat cardiac dysrhythmia but whose mechanism is still obscure. 
            Relevant studies focus on patch/lead configurations; tissue response to the delivery of different defibrillation waveform characteristics such as magnitude, energy, frequency, duration; timing; strength-duration curve; strength-interval curve; anisotropic myocardial activation mapping; and so on. 
            Description of extracellular electrical stimulation process relates transmembrane action potential, including first induced changes in transmembrane potential at stimulus and then activation of transmembrane voltage-dependent ion channels.<br> 
            Cardiac mapping enables visualizing temporal and spatial distribution of electrical potential on body surface, epicardial, or endocardial level, which can provide elucidation of tachycardia mechanism, including impulse initiation and wavefront propagation. 
            The activation mapping technique benefits catheter ablation therapy for tachycardia treatments a lot, which is mainly achieved by endocardial bipolar recording from critical locations within chambers via intracardiac electrograms and epicardial mapping with subxiphoid percutaneous approach can extend catheter ablation treatment scope to ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial tachycardiac (AT), atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). 
            Optical mapping enables observation of wavefront in response of myocardial excitation during this process in tissue level. In cellular level, two-dimensional anatomic activation mapping with anisotropic myocardium by altering resistance distribution can provide entailed data describing transmembrane action potential during defibrillation process.<br>
            An existing mathematical model (Luo-Rudy model) has been applied to computer program in this project.  I generated a sheet represents a small surface of the cardiac conduction system and each cells in it represents a cardiac cell with dielectric properties and ion channels.  I used MATLAB for some calculations and C++ for programming.  All status data and parameters are recorded in txt files

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <div class="col-sm-9 wow fadeInLeftBig">  
          <p class="lead">
            Strength-interval curve describes excitability of cardiac tissue recovering from refractoriness, which measures the threshold stimulus strength necessary to generate an action potential at different time intervals after a previous action potential.
            To understand how defibrillation shock interacts with myocardium in terminating fibrillation, the strength-interval curve is investigated, which describes refractory response to the defibrillation shock in terms of a unipolar transmembrane stimulation by determining if a stimulus with high amplitude changes the strength ability of a second stimulus to capture.
            It is achieved by pacing several beats at the same cycle length and then delivering a second stimuls at an interval around the refractory period to see if the second stimulus produce a propagated response.<br>

            The mechanism of refractoriness is shown in Fig 3.3, the fibrillation is initiated by S0 when the ventricle is in relative refractory period. S1 is a defibrillation shock. 
            What the strength-interval curve gives is the strength and timing factors of S1 to terminate the action potential caused by S0. 
            The strength-interval curve describes how refractory tissues respond to stimulus (S1) in terms of obtaining the threshold of stimulus strength and the corresponding moment of stimulus being applied, that is, the amplitude of S1 is the function of time period between the application of S0 and S1.

          The development of 2D myocardial model based on Luo-Rudy model makes the elucidation of electrophysiology process possible, whose specialties are junctional resistance for anisotropy and membrane capacitance for transient response of intracellular, extracellular, and transmembrane stimulation. 
          Pacing and defibrillating processes can be investigated, and optimal parameters can be found.
          The 2D anatomic activation mapping with unipolar transmembrane catheter recordings are applied the same electrode (same site) based on the geometry.<br>
          The properties of S0 and S1 are listed in the table.

        <p class="lead">
          The pacing rate affects the strength-interval curve. 
          The hypothesis is that the difference in pacing rates has no effect on the shape of strength-interval curve but shifts strength-interval curve. 
          The pacing interval is set to be 210msec, which is right after the refractoriness, as is shown in Fig(a). 
          The minimum S1 intensity at earliest moment of S1 necessary to reliably break the previous action potential is defined as strength threshold of S1. 
          S1 must exceed a critical amplitude and must be applied after absolute refractory period.<br>
          The sign of effective defibrillation shock can be regarded as the 2nd pulse of S0 cannot initiate an action potential at t=210msec. 
          The reason is that the defibrillation shock S1 has broken the refractoriness ahead of time, that is, S1 breaks the fibrillation caused by 1st pulse of S0. 
          Figure(b) shows that S1 has been successfully delivered and captured, indicating such S1 exceeds the strength threshold at that delivery moment.<br>
          The sign of defibrillation shock delivery failure is that S1 failed to break the fibrillation so that the 2nd pulse of S0 can initiate an action potential at t=210msec, which is shown in Figure(c).<br>
          Extracellular potassium concentration [K+]o affects the strength-interval curve since high [K+]o raises the resting potential so that raise depolarization, as is shown in Figure(d).
          Thus, high [K+]o makes it easier for S1 to break fibrillation and makes it harder for 2nd pulse of S0 to initiate pacing beat.

          Extracellular potassium concentration [K+]o is doubled from 4.5mM to 9mM by saving the state in StateV.txt file and then loading StateX.txt file with altered [K+]o, which is shown in Figure(e).  
          The same procedures are conducted under the circumstance of high extracellular potassium concentration.
          Data for plotting strength-interval curves are recorded in Figure(f)-(g). 
        </p>
      </div>
  
      
      <div class="col-sm-6 wow fadeInLeftBig">

        <p class="lead">
          The evaluation of threshold at each instant is by decreasing amplitude at a certain interval and checked by decreasing time interval at a certain amplitude. 
          The first set of data are recorded when the duration of S1 is 10msec and the second set of data are recorded when the duration of S1 is 4msec. 
          The former S1 possesses more energy than latter S1.<br>
          For the case of Ko=4.5mM, the earliest 2nd pulse of S0 that can pace (with amplitude=0.3uA and duration=0.4msec) to results in an action potential is at t=195msec. 
          If S1 is too closed to the 2nd pulse of S0 and an action potential is successfully initiated, we cannot tell either S1 or 2nd pulse of S0 is responsible for such an effect. 
          So, data of S1 amplitude are recorded prior to t=195msec to avoid the circumstance that S1 pace but whose real purpose is to defibrillate.<br>
          For the case of Ko=9mM, the earliest 2nd pulse of S0 that can pace (with amplitude =0.3uA and duration=0.4msec) to results in an action potential is at t=180msec. 
          So, data of S1 amplitude are recorded prior to t=180msec.

      <div class="col-sm-12 wow fadeInRightBig">        
        <p class="lead">
          The data are denoted as ‘*’ in graphs for the case of Ko=4.5mM. 
          Interpolation method is used for curve fitting. 
          Black is used to record data for the case of S1 duration=10msec and red is used to record data for the case of S1 duration=4msec.
          A monotonical decrement as the interval increases is because of easier stimulation along with reduction in refractoriness caused by S0 action potential. 
          The black curve is to the left of the red curve indicating easier to defibrillate in terms of identical S1 amplitude at shorter interval among relative refractory period since it possesses more energy in unit amplitude.<br>
          The data are denoted as ‘o’ in graphs for the case of Ko=9mM. 
          The dashed lines are fitted for data for the case of Ko=9mM.<br>
          Fig(h) shows the comparison of strength-interval curves in different level extracellular potassium concentration for the cases of S1 duration equals 10msec and 4msec.
          High extracellular potassium concentration raises resting potential and depolarizes tissue. 
          The depolarization is added on resting potential, increasing the initial level of transmembrane potential, making S1 easier to defibrillate the action potential caused by S0. 
          Thus, for the case of Ko=9mM, the strength-interval curve is to the left, indicating identical S1 amplitude can be used to defibrillate at shorter interval due to the reduction in refractory period.

        <p class="lead">
          Defibrillation works in the treatment of certain tachycardia. 
          The high pacing rate affects the strength-interval curve by shifting to left with the same shape due to the reduction of action potential duration. 
          For example, for the case of Ko=9mM and S1 duration equals 10msec, the maximum amplitude that can be obtained is 3.9uA. 
          And for the case of Ko=4.5mM and S1 duration equals 4msec, the maximum amplitude that can be obtained is 4.2uA. 
          By extending this model with multipolarities of stimulus, the exploration on strength-interval curve characteristics based on anodal versus cathodal stimulation respectively.
