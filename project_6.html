            Biomimetic scaffolds fabrications relying on Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing technique has received attentions in the discipline of 3D cell culture and tissue engineering due to high cell affinity in consequence of high resolution patterns being provided. 
            Polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions can be used as biomaterials for printing high resolution scaffolds with the fiber diameter ranging from micrometers to nanometers.
            The motivation of fabricating biomimetic scaffold is to achieve a biodegradable microstructure for cell differentiation and proliferation, a necessity in the field of tissue engineering. 
            Tissue engineering can potentially provide revolutionized clinical treatment of simplifying medical implant by bypassing the need of fostering. 
            This simplification leads to both budget cut down and the compatibility to patients' immune system to avoid rejection.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            The objective of this project is to probe the correlation between fabrication process factors and fiber characteristics in terms of scaffold morphologies. 
            According to EHD technique, fabrication process factors are calibrated for a formation of stable Taylor cone. 
            Fiber characteristics are analyzed based on the development of bending instability of charged jet. 
            Scaffolds with two typical structures (grid & spiral) are observed by optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), whose physical properties are examined by tensile test and potential bio-applications are evaluated by cell culture studies.

            EHD studies the motion of ionized particles and their interaction with electric field while the polymer solution is becoming electrified fluid. 
            A motion stage, a nozzle, a substrate, and a D.C. power supply constitute the Electrohydrodynamics Jet (EHDJ) Printing System.
            As a polymer solution, PCL solutions can be used as biomaterials for printing high resolution scaffolds with the fiber diameter ranging from micrometers to nanometers. 
            Taylor interpreted the phenomenon of electrified fluids in motion as the “leaky dielectric model”. 
            The formation of Taylor cone is an essential indicator on assessing whether the charged liquid jet is stable or not. 
            EHDJ is viable to fabricate 3D scaffolds since PCL solution can be induced to achieve controllable orientation and precise deposition.<br>

            The EHD jetting system is illustrated in Fig 6.1. 
            The high precision motorized stage is from Aerotech Company (Pittsburgh, PA USA), whose motion can be programmable controlled in 3 dimensions for accurate fiber deposition. 
            Program control is achieved by the software called Ensemble IDE through a communication interface. 
            The electric field between nozzle and substrate is generated by a D.C. power supply.
            PCL solutions, as the biomaterial, are made by dissolving PCL pellets in acetic acid. 
            The syringe pump (New Era Pump System) acts as a solution feeding system with stable pumping speeds.

            EHD technique can overcome inherent limitation of conventional inkjet printing associated with nozzle size for the case of high resolution printing. 
            Interacted with electrical and mechanical forces, liquid can be induced to achieve controllable orientation and precise deposition.
            Involving intrinsic properties of fluids (surface tension, viscoelasticity, conductivity, dielectric constant, and etc.) and operating process factors (flow rate, voltage supply, nozzle-to-substrate distance, and etc.), such fluid cannot be treated as Newtonian fluid. 
            Instead, "leaky dielectric model" is constructed to interpret the phenomenon of electrified fluids. 
            During EHD ejection, charge is distributed on the surface of PCL solution.
            After D.C. voltage is applied, the tangential component of electric field contributes a stress that tangent to the surface, requiring a force able to achieve a balance, which is the viscous.

          PCL solution intrinsic property<br>
          As a non-Newtonian fluid, effect of viscoelasticity of PCL solution on Taylor cone charged jet can be investigated in terms of two parameters independently, which are elasticity and viscosity, reflected by solution molecular weight and solution concentration respectively.
          As an intrinsic property, PCL solution whips in terms of a spiral pattern even without a D.C. field. 
          The reason for such flowing motion is that there is a gradient of density at the interface between fluids, which are the air and the PCL solution. 
          When a D.C. voltage is applied, a gradient of electric field strength exists due to a gradient of dielectric constant. 
          The field gradient translates into electrostatic pressure, serving to amplify fluctuation at the interface between fluids.

          Process parameters<br>
          • voltage: D.C. voltage supply initiates EHD jetting process, where the formation of Taylor cone indicates surface tension is overcome.<br>
          • feed rate: Feed rate affects fiber formation. If it is low, it is hard to form Taylor cone. If it is high, solution accumulates. High feed rate indicates large fiber diameter.<br>
          In addition, an increment in elasticity can widen the range of voltage but has no interference in the range of feed rate. 
          An increment in viscosity can widen the range of feed rate at low concentration and stabilizes voltage at high viscosity.<br>
          • nozzle-to-substrate distance: Nozzle-to-substrate distance is constrained below 5mm to avoid whipping. 
          Higher voltage supply can accelerate whipping process.<br>
          • stage speed: Steady speed of stage is required to match feed rate to achieve precision deposition. For example, high stage speed indicates scattered spiral fibers.<br>
          Jet formations can be classified as the following four modes in accordance with varying feed rate (FR) and voltage supply (V). 
          When FR and V are low, PCL solution drips due to the gravity. 
          When FR or V is slightly increased, lower than the critical point that can form a Taylor cone, PCL solution pulsates. 
          As further increasing V to meet the threshold value, the Taylor cone is formed along with stable ejection. 
          If V exceeds the threshold value, PCL solution sprays or even in a complex jetting mode.

      <div class="col-sm-6 wow fadeInLeftBig">        
        <p class="lead">
          Discharge preclusion<br>
          The phenomenon of discharge impairs the stability of Taylor cone and the precision of fiber deposition. 
          The frequent occurrence of point discharge can be attributed to the highly non-uniform electric field. 
          Corona discharge is self-sustained and initiated when the electric field strength exceeds critical value of corona ignition. 
          The air possesses insulating property when the applied voltage is below corona inception voltage. 
          Thus, larger difference between corona inception voltage and breakdown voltage of air indicates a slight possibility of corona discharge.
          Corona discharges can be classified based in the polarity of electrodes, which are positive corona discharge and negative corona discharge.
          When the nozzle acts as the cathode and the substrate acts as the anode, the corona inception voltage is far away from the breakdown voltage of air, indicating a slight possibility of discharge. 
          Thus, the optimized connection is demonstrated in Fig 6.3 as positive connecting to the substrate and negative connecting to the nozzle.

              Fiber solidification<br>
              Fiber solidification is essential to fabricate scaffolds for uniformly alignment and accuracy porosity calculation. 
              Poor fiber solidification manifests two features, which are fiber merging and imprecise fiber deposition, which can be attributed to short elongated time refined by short nozzle-to-substrate distance and Coulomb repulsion respectively.<br>
              • Effect of Viscoelasticity<br>
              For Taylor cone zone, the increment in elasticity can widen the range of applied voltage and has no interference in the range of flow rate. 
              For Taylor cone zone, the increment in viscosity can widen the range of feed rate for low concentrated PCL solution but stabilize the range of voltage for high concentrated PCL solution. 
              Elasticity is reflected by molecular weight and solvent viscosity and viscosity is controlled by changing polymer concentration.
              For example, when the diameter of Taylor cone is large, viscosity displays greater effect than elasticity does, which promotes the jet to shrink for a smaller diameter. 
              Further optimization can be realized by increasing solution concentration, leading to the increment in viscosity, which further reduce jet diameter. 
              Small jet diameter indicates large surface area to volume ratio, implying a high evaporation rate during the limited nozzle-to-substrate distance. 
              However, in the case of low viscosity, substrate surface property has comparatively significant effect on fiber diameter.<br>
              • Separation Distance and Interval between Fibers
              Due to the insufficient evaporation of acetic acid on each fiber, like charges on fibers demonstrate the effect of Coulomb repulsion. 
              For example, fibers depart from the same position are supposed to convene to form the same line, but they are gradually repulsed from each other to form parallel lines.

            Grid scaffolding<br>
            After utilizing above techniques, fiber solidification is improved. After the operating process factors (feed rate & voltage) matching the intrinsic property (viscoelasticity in terms of molecular weight & concentration) of PCL solution, fiber solidification can be achieved.
            In addition to providing a better environment for cell attachment and proliferation, scaffolds with highly aligned fibers possess a greater level of mechanical anisotrophy, which is preferred in tissue engineering.
            Grid scaffolds with pore size equals to 50 um can be achieved by accumulating layers by offsetting.

              Besides polymer surface tension, permittivity in vacuum, liquid dielectric, and electric field strength in polymer, applied voltage, as the most accessible process factor, is involved. 
              Intensive electric field in terms of high D.C. voltage supply can accelerate the development of bending instability.
              The bending instability of electrified PCL solution is triggered by whipping of lateral velocity and position of the jet. 
              The repulsion of charges elongates the jet in the path of spiral pattern until the end of jet is deposited on the substrate.<br>
              Monolayer scaffolding is the result of fiber deposition on the substrate. 
              The morphology of fiber deposition is the combination of fiber whipping speed (Vfiber) and stage speed (Vss). 
              As the stage is stationary, the accumulation of the coiled pattern demonstrates bending instability of charged jet. 
              As the stage is moving at a constant speed, the collected fiber shows the exact fiber morphology at the certain nozzle-to-substrate distance. 
              The electric force exerted on PCL solution forms Taylor cone. 
              The intensive force overcomes the surface tension of Taylor cone, so that a straight fiber is stretched. 
              The intrinsic property of PCL solution whips the straight fiber so that the fiber transforms into a coiled fiber, so called "fluid rope-coil" by Mahadevan et. al. 
              From the periodic fiber deposition, the difference in magnitude, duty cycle, and fiber diameter can be told.

          Monolayer morphology characteristic is the effect of diverse fiber characteristic and multilayer morphology characteristic is the application of diverse fiber characteristic.<br>
          • Monolayer morphology characteristic<br>
          When nozzle-to-substrate distance increases and other conditions remain the same, the effect of bending instability can be represented by monolayer morphologies in terms of magnitude, duty cycle, and fiber diameter.
          Monolayer morphologies are varied as nozzle-to-substrate distance increase while the other process factors remain constant.

          • Monolayer fabrication summary by varying process factors<br>
          The monolayer morphology can be summarized based on varying process parameters (nozzle-to-substrate distance and stage speed).<br>
          When nozzle-to-substrate distance is below 1.6mm, corona discharge cannot be eliminated. 
          When nozzle-to-substrate distance is beyond 4mm, the deposited fiber is not uniform and periodic since the whipping exceeds 1st bending instability. 
          Fiber deposition includes two or more cycles is featured of low controllability during fabrication. 
          When Vss cannot match Vfiber in terms of high moving speed, the deposited fibers are discontinuous, which is less useful in cell culture. 
          The range for generating grid scaffolds (straight fiber) and spiral scaffolds (coiled fiber) is important as the standard of calibration. 
          Among the effective fabricating region (grid and spiral), at lower nozzle-to-substrate distance, 2.7 mm < D < 4.2 mm, spiral scaffolds can be generated when the applied voltage is in the range of 3.1kV and 3.2kV.
          The three samples taken by optical microscope indicates that spiral scaffolds become sparse and scattered with the increment in stage speed.

        • Multilayer morphology characteristics<br>
        Spiral scaffolds are featured of high porosity, which can be beneficial to cell proliferation due to the convenience of nutrition transmission.
        Spiral scaffolding performs better than grid scaffolding since high porosity benefits cell attachment.
        The typical characteristics of multilayer spiral scaffolds with "peak" formation can be interpreted by the development of bending instability of charged jet.

          • Mechanical Property Evaluation<br>
          A strain-stress curve can be divided into 3 parts: elastic region, plastic region, and break region. 
          In elastic region, stress is proportional to strain. 
          Young's elastic Modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain. 
          The threshold value from elastic region to plastic region can be described as yield strain and yield stress.
          The threshold value from plastic region to break region can be expressed as ultimate strain and ultimate force.
          The grid scaffold has a very high yield point and a very high break point, indicating high extension tolerance and great ductility.
